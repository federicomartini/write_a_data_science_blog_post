## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Stack Overflow data from 2020 to answer to the question:

* With a low formal education and no experience in Software Development, which programming languages should I study to earn more and what's the salary I can aim at if I want to move to the United States?

To answer that question, I broke down the study to answer multiple questions, that are:

1. What languages were most popular in 2020 worldwide?
2. Should I learn the most popular languages to earn more?
3. Do you need a high formal education to aim at a high salary in Software Development?
4. As a software developer with low formal education, what could be your salary in United States?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is one notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions. The notebook is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

The **Archive** folder contains the Dataset about the [**Stackoverflow's 2020 Annual Developer Survey**](https://www.kaggle.com/aitzaz/stack-overflow-developer-survey-2020).

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@martini.f/what-can-you-do-to-aim-at-a-good-salary-in-the-united-states-as-a-software-developer-if-your-7fb68d6d4102).
